String favoriteHobby = "programming";
int numberOfToes = 10;
int degreesInARightAngle = 90;
int myAge = 12;
Stringprograming = "Java";
doublenumber= 3.14159;
2. Initialize these variables...
    String whatIWantToBeWhenIGrowUp = "actor";
    int facebookFriends = 0;
    String myBirthday = "August 9" ;
    int sidesInATriangle = 3;
3. Declare and initialize variables for...
   Stringgift = gift card- what you got for your birthday
    Stringfood= sandwhich ­ the last meal you ate
  inttime = 9:00  ­ what time you go to bed
 introbot= 5 ­ how many Robot programs you have written
 
 1. Complete the for loop below so that it prints out the numbers 1­10.
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		
	
}
2. Complete the for loop below so that it counts down and prints out 75 to 50.
	for (int i = 50; i > 75; i--) {
		
	
}
3. Describe briefly what each part of the for loop does: 
for( a ; b ; c )
{               } 
a) desides what i starts off as
b)desides when to stop 
c) desides to count down or up

1. Declare a string variable and initialize it to “yes”. If the string is equal to yes, print “happy” otherwise print
“sad”. Then print "Wednesday".

	String s= "yes";
	if(s.equals("yes")){
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Happy");		
	}else {
	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "sad");	
	}
	
		
	
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Wednseday");	
	

}
}

What happense if you set the string variable to "no"? 
2. Declare an int variable to hold your age and initialize its value. If you are under 20, print “It’s so great being
young”, otherwise print “Don’t you wish you were young!”
	
		int yourage = 0;
JOptionPane.showInputDialog("How old are you?");
		if(yourage<20) 
			if(yourage>20)
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"It's so great being young?" );

		
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Don't you wish you were young?" );
}
}

3. Make an input pop­up to ask the user which animal they like. If the user types “dog”, print “Dogs go woof”,
otherwise if they type “cat”, print “Cats go meow” ....and so on with other animals. If you do not have code for
the animal they type, print “I don’t know that animal.”


	String input=JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What animal do you like?");
	
	
	if(input.equals("Dog")){
		
		
	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Dog goes woof.");
	}
	else if(input.equals("Cat")) {
	
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Cat goes meow.");
	}
	
	else {
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"I don't know that animal.");
	}
	}
}
